// Simple static proxy for serving the CV PDF from /pdf/cv.pdf
// Place this file in your public directory as public/pdf/cv.pdf
// No server code needed for static hosting, just move the file.

// If you are using Vite, Next.js, or similar, place the PDF in the public/pdf folder.
// Then use href="/pdf/cv.pdf" in your anchor tag.
